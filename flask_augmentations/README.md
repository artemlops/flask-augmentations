# Flask-server to explore augmentations

This package contains a Flask application to render image augmentations.

**Warning**: It is highly insecure and is NOT recommended to run in production.

- The package is organized as a proper Python package installable via `pip` (so that no hacks like `sys.append` or `export PYTHONPATH` are needed).

- To improve code quality, we implemented linters + auto-formatters (`black`, `flake`, `isort`) and type checker (`mypy`).
